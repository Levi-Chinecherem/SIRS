## Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication

**Objective**: Set up the Django project and implement user authentication with role-based access.

### What it does:
- Initializes the Django project and creates the `authentication` app.
- Extends the default User model to include custom fields like role and department.
- Implements login and registration functionality with role-based access control.

### How it does it:
1. Create a Django project named `sirs_project` using `django-admin startproject sirs_project`.
2. Create the `authentication` app with `python manage.py startapp authentication`.
3. Extend Django’s `AbstractUser` model in `authentication/models.py` to include fields: `role` (admin, data owner, general user), `department`, and `avatar_initials`.
4. Implement login and registration views in `authentication/views.py` using Django’s built-in authentication system with custom forms defined in `authentication/forms.py`.
5. Configure static files (`static/`) for Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons, and media files (`media/`) for document uploads in `sirs_project/settings.py`.
6. Implement role-based access control using Django’s groups and permissions in `authentication/views.py`.
7. Create templates (`login.html`, `register.html`) in `authentication/templates/authentication/` for user interaction.

### Tools involved:
- **Django**: Web framework for project structure and authentication.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (Lucide icons)**: Frontend styling and icons.

## Phase 2: Document Management

**Objective**: Create the `documents` app to handle document uploads, listing, and management.

### What it does:
- Allows users to upload, list, and manage their documents.
- Encrypts uploaded documents for security.

### How it does it:
1. Create the `documents` app with `python manage.py startapp documents`.
2. Define the `Document` model in `documents/models.py` with fields: `title`, `file`, `category`, `access_level`, `department`, `tags`, `description`, `upload_date`, `owner`, `size`, `views`, and `encryption_key`.
3. Implement views in `documents/views.py` and templates in `documents/templates/documents/` for:
   - Uploading documents (`upload.html`) with metadata.
   - Listing and filtering user’s documents (`my_documents.html`).
4. Use the `cryptography` library to encrypt uploaded files with AES-256 in `documents/views.py`.
5. Enforce access control based on `access_level` using Django permissions.

### Tools involved:
- **Django**: Web framework for app structure.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **cryptography library**: For file encryption.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend for document management.

## Phase 3: Search Functionality

**Objective**: Implement advanced search capabilities for documents.

### What it does:
- Allows users to search documents using various filters and search types.
- Displays search results with relevant metadata.

### How it does it:
1. Implement search views in `documents/views.py` (or a dedicated search app) to process queries with filters: search type (semantic, keyword, hybrid), document type, date range, and access level.
2. Use Django ORM for basic searches or integrate Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities (configured in `sirs_project/settings.py` if used).
3. Create a search results template (`search_results.html`) in `documents/templates/documents/` to display results with title, metadata, keywords, relevance score, and actions (preview, download, request access).

### Tools involved:
- **Django**: Web framework for search logic.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Elasticsearch (optional)**: For advanced search functionality.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend for search display.

## Phase 4: AI Chat Search

**Objective**: Integrate an AI-powered chat interface for natural language document queries.

### What it does:
- Provides a chat interface where users can ask natural language questions to search for documents.
- Uses NLP to process queries and return relevant document results.

### How it does it:
1. Create the `chat` app with `python manage.py startapp chat`.
2. Integrate an NLP model (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) in `chat/views.py` to process user queries.
3. Implement views in `chat/views.py` to handle chat input, process queries, and return document results.
4. Design the chat interface template (`chat.html`) in `chat/templates/chat/` with message history, AI responses, and a sidebar for features and recent chats.

### Tools involved:
- **Django**: Web framework for chat app.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: NLP for query processing.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend for chat interface.

## Phase 5: Access Requests

**Objective**: Implement a system for managing document access requests.

### What it does:
- Allows users to request access to restricted documents.
- Enables document owners to approve or deny access requests.

### How it does it:
1. Define the `AccessRequest` model in `documents/models.py` (or a separate app) with fields: `requester`, `document`, `status`, `request_date`, `reason`, and `priority`.
2. Implement views in `documents/views.py` and templates in `documents/templates/documents/` for:
   - Submitting access requests (`request_access.html`).
   - Viewing and managing pending requests (`manage_requests.html`) with approve/deny options.
3. Add logic in `documents/views.py` to update document access based on request status.

### Tools involved:
- **Django**: Web framework for access request logic.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend for request management.

## Phase 6: Admin Features

**Objective**: Build the admin panel with tools for system management and monitoring.

### What it does:
- Provides an admin dashboard with analytics, user management, system logs, security center, and encryption key management.

### How it does it:
1. Create the `admin_panel` app with `python manage.py startapp admin_panel`.
2. Implement views in `admin_panel/views.py` and templates in `admin_panel/templates/admin_panel/` for:
   - **Admin Dashboard** (`dashboard.html`): Display stats (active users, documents, searches, security events) and placeholders for charts.
   - **User Management** (`user_management.html`): Table with user details and options to add, edit, or deactivate users.
   - **System Logs** (`system_logs.html`): Filterable log table with export functionality.
   - **Security Center** (`security_center.html`): Display security health metrics, threat alerts, and toggle controls (e.g., 2FA, data masking).
   - **Encryption Keys** (`encryption_keys.html`): Table with key details and options to generate or rotate keys.
3. Use Django’s admin interface or custom views for these features.

### Tools involved:
- **Django**: Web framework for admin features.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend for admin panel.
- **Chart.js (optional)**: For dashboard charts.

## Phase 7: Security and Testing

**Objective**: Secure the system and ensure it is thoroughly tested.

### What it does:
- Implements encryption, access control, and logging.
- Tests the system for functionality and security.

### How it does it:
1. Implement AES-256 encryption for documents and keys using the `cryptography` library in `documents/views.py`.
2. Enforce role-based permissions and document access levels across all apps.
3. Set up logging for all significant actions (uploads, logins, security events) using a `Log` model in `admin_panel/models.py`.
4. Write unit tests for models, views, and forms in each app’s `tests.py`.
5. Perform integration tests for page interactions and security features using Django’s testing framework.
6. Conduct security testing (e.g., penetration testing) with tools like OWASP ZAP.

### Tools involved:
- **Django**: Web framework for security and testing.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **cryptography library**: For encryption.
- **Django’s testing framework**: For unit and integration tests.
- **Security testing tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP)**: For vulnerability assessment.
